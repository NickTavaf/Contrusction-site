<p>This closer photo shows workers preparing the reinforcement and formwork for a concrete wall or column. You can see vertical steel rebar tied together and wooden or metal framing panels being set up around it,these create the mold that will hold wet concrete in place as it hardens. The yellow pieces are spacers and caps, which help keep the rebar properly positioned and protect workers from the sharp ends. It looks like they’re just about ready for another concrete pour, which will form one of the structural walls or supports for the next level of the building.</p>
